The course form is highly hands-on. Each topic starts with an approximately
10-15 minute session where you run and adapt some R code. Next, we will provide
background and details on what you just did. After that there is a more
in-depth assignment. Depending on time and topic we will discuss the topic more
in-depth after that.


### Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of R/RStudio, explicitly:

- Work with the R command line and R scripts
